How sweet the sound \n That saved a wretch like me! \n I once was lost, but now am found \n Was blind, but now I see.\n\n \u2019Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\nAnd grace my fears relieved; \nHow precious did that grace appear \nThe hour I first believed. \n\n Through many dangers, toils and snares, \nI have already come;\n\u2019Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\nAnd grace will lead me home. \n\n The Lord has promised good to me,\n His Word my hope secures;\nHe will my Shield and Portion be,\nAs long as life endures.\n\n The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,\nThe sun forbear to shine;\nBut God, Who called me here below, \nShall be forever mine. \n\n When we\u2019ve been there ten thousand years,\n Bright shining as the sun,\n We\u2019ve no less days to sing God\u2019s praise\nThan when we\u2019d first begun.\n",
